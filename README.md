## Purpose

Prettier is one of the best tools that really help developers not to waste time on codestyle.

Listed below are some of the ways one could employ prettier in a project:

- [Editor Integration](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html)

  - Pros:
    - no overhead bootstrapping code
    - autoformatting on every save

  - Cons:
    - every developer needs to setup and configure editor's plugin manually
    - teammates can have conflicting plugin settings that might override default settings in an unpredictable way. Or one could forget to install `node_modules` and a globally installed `prettier` will be used instead, which might be of older version, etc. This leads to frustrating hiccups in the workflow and, potentially, bugs.

- [Pre-commit Hook](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html)

  - Pros:
    - works in the background (i.e. developer doesn't have to think about it)
    - consistent prettier settings in the project
  
  - Cons:
    - you can not see prettier changes on save

- [Watching For Changes](https://prettier.io/docs/en/watching-files.html)

  + Pros:
    - no overhead bootstrapping code
    - autoformatting on every save
    - works in the background
    - consistent prettier settings in the project
  
  - Cons:
    - if you already have another watcher (e.g. `webpack-dev-server` or `watchman`), you'll be wasting resources and your bundler will be triggered twice on every change: first by user, then by prettier formatting

- [CLI](https://prettier.io/docs/en/cli.html)

  + Pros:
    - no overhead bootstrapping code
  
  - Cons:
    - you can not see prettier changes on save
    - prone to errors unless stored somewhere (e.g. npm-scripts)

- [This Webpack Loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-loader)

  + Pros:
    - autoformatting on every save (if working with webpack-dev-server)
    - works in the background
    - consistent prettier settings in the project
    - updates all the codebase when new prettier version is released
  
  - Cons:
    - works only on webpack-dependent projects

In short, idea is to make source code auto-`prettier`-fy on every save. But to do it in a cross-IDE manner. Use of `webpack`, eliminates the need to install and configure plugins on each developer's machine and also provides better efficency, as no other watchers are needed.

## Features

- support [prettier configuration files](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html): `.prettierrc`, `prettier.config.js`, `"prettier"` key in your `package.json` file
- support of [ignoring code](https://prettier.io/docs/en/ignore.html) using both comments and `.prettierignore` file
- override configuration files in loader options
- zero configuration of loader options for supporting all features out of the box

## Requirements

- webpack >= 2
- prettier >= 1.6

Create an issue on pr, if you __really__ need to support Webpack 1.

## Installation

```
npm install prettier-loader prettier --save-dev
```

## Usage

### Minimal config example

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        use: {
          loader: 'prettier-loader',
          exclude: /node_modules/,
        }
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

### Full config example with description

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        use: {
          loader: 'prettier-loader',

          // force this loader to run first if it's not first in loaders list
          enforce: 'pre',

          // avoid running prettier on all the files!
          // use it only on your source code and not on dependencies!
          exclude: /node_modules/,
          
          // additional prettier options assigned to options in
          // - .prettierrc,
          // - prettier.config.js,
          // - "prettier" property in package.json
          options: {
            trailingComma: 'es5',
            tabWidth: 4,
            
            // additional options object for resolveConfig method
            // @see https://prettier.io/docs/en/api.html#prettierresolveconfigfilepath-options
            resolveConfigOptions: {
              editorconfig: true,
              config: 'config/prettier.config.js'
            },

            // skip rewriting source file.
            // if true, only prettier the output
            skipRewritingSource: false,
          },
        }
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

### Watch mode

2 examples above fit for case, when you run webpack not in watch mode, because in watch-mode there is a double writing source file (by user, and after watching change made by prettier-loader). But there is workaround:

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      // prettier-loader as in example above
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        use: {
          loader: 'prettier-loader',
          enforce: 'pre',
          exclude: /node_modules/,
        }
      },

      // other loaders...

      // and tiny helper loader, that caches the result of all loaders
      // for prettier-loader to pitch cached result to webpack
      // without running new build after changing source file by prettier
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        use: {
          loader: 'prettier-loader/watch-helper',
          // make shure that it is the last loader in chain,
          // because it must cache result of the whole chain
          enforce: 'post',
          exclude: /node_modules/,
        }
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

### Working with HTML preprocessor

If ou work with HTML preprocessor (Twig, EJS, Nunjucks, ...), you may want to process the output stream.
Still you don't want the input template to be rewritten with the output.
In that case, you'll need to tell the loader to keep the source file unchanged.

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.njk?$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'html-loader',
          },
          {
            loader: 'prettier-loader',
            options: {
              skipRewritingSource: true,
            },
          },
          {
            loader: 'nunjucks-html-loader',
          },
        ],
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

## Pro Tip

Install and use it only in development environment if you minimize code for production, don't do unnecessary work!
